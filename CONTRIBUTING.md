# CONTRIBUTION
This is a simple bash script to manage your assembly projects. You may contribute to this project with all of your unique ideas
like features, patches, or something else that doesn't relate to inappropriate and not so polite items or faults.
It's not the best so instead of hoping it being the best, I'm hoping you as contributors to give all of your best.


sincerely,
Iyan.
